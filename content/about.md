# About

I'm Pedro Henrique Di Francia Rosso. I'm currently a PhD student at Unicamp (Campinas - Brazil).

I got my bachelor's in Computer Engineering in 2018 at UFSC (Araranguá - Brazil). During my graduation, I've developed several activities, like monitoring students of Data Structures course, programming marathons, and Scientific Initiation, where I studied wireless sensing applied to health (EMG) and finished my degree studying image recoloration for dichromats. UFSC and CREA-SC awarded me for being the best student.

In 2021, obtained my Master's degree in Computer Science at UFABC (Santo André - Brazil). My dissertation was about Fault Tolerance based on MPI, and applied to the [OmpCluster](https://ompcluster.gitlab.io) project that uses OpenMP to parallelize applications to HPC clusters.

Now, I'm continuing studying Fault Tolerance, expanding my master's project.
